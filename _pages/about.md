Welcome to my blog fellow Internet user.

My name is Richard Raumberger living in Graz, Austria.
I'm interested in Astronomy, Astrophotography and Software Development and these are mostly the topics you will find on my blog.

Since 2013 I'm working full-time as a Software Developer and as a side-project I build and maintain a homelab.

In 2023 I picked up Astrophotography as a hobby and am looking forward to the next clear night.

Thanks for stopping by on my page.

Quick note: What you find on this blog represents my own opinions and thoughts and not the opinions of my employer.

The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heart_Nebula">Heart Nebula</a> is without a doubt one of the most beautiful constellations out there.
Eventually I had to give it a try as well... and in my opinion it turned out very well.
It really is amazing which wonders one can see in the nightsky ... even with city lights.

I also tried to create a starless version for the first time. I'm uncertain which version I like better as both have their appeal.

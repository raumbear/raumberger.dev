For the first time, I gave a try to my SHO filters.
As a target for the session on December, 8th 2023, I chose the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281" target="_blank">Pacman Nebula</a>.
The result however, isn't really what I was hoping for.

In the end it turned out too overprocessed, but it still was worth giving it a shot.

Sadly, my battery gave out sooner than anticipated and I only acquired 20mins worth of Oxygen footage.

I'll probably give NGC 281 another try some time in the future.

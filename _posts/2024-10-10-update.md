Sorry for the long time since my last update and LOOOONNNGGG downtime of this blog. A lot of things happened this year.

Among other things, I finally moved into a new flat which took quite some time, obviously.

I also managed to switch the deployment for this blog to something more reliable. So the uptime should be drastically better from now on :)

As for astrophotography. Sadly, this year's nightsky was a bit cursed at my location.
So far - and we already have October - there have only been few days in total without a cloudy night sky.
Also with my move to a new flat I sadly lost access to my previous astrophotography spot. But I managed to find some arrangement now which gives me access to an EXCELLENT spot.
I'm actually quite hyped for the next clear night.

As for the few nights with a suitable sky... I tried my best to do some astrophotography but for one reason or another every session turned out cursed.
Sometimes due to technical issues with the battery, sometimes due to simple human error (e.g. me forgetting the dew heater at home)

However, nonetheless.. I'm looking forward to winter season which hopefully has less cloudy nights.

With that being said,
Clear Skies everyone.

After giving my imaging train a proper clean, I slewed my telescope towards the infamous <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andromeda_Galaxy" target="_blank">Andromeda Galaxy</a> on December, 2nd 2023.
With some proper flat images and some basic processing, I think the result turned out pretty nice.

I'm quite happy with the result.

This was my first attempt at an LHaRGB combination in PixInsight, which turned out to be not as scary as I thought.
I sadly missed out on a lot of detail without the OIII and SII information in the end.

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_1491">The Fossil Footprint</a> definitely offers beautiful detail and I might spend some additional nights on this target to really give it the exposure it deserves.

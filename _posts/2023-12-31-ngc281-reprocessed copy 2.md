As the weather really hasn't been in my favor, I made another attempt at processing my previous footage of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NGC_281" target="_blank">Pacman Nebula</a>.
My previous image really didn't do it justice, but I'm very pleased with the result this time.

However, I'm wondering how much better the image would look like if I had acquired better footage.
NGC281 remains on my list for recapturing.
